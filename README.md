## Google Performance Tools Runner

Web frontend which allows users to simultaneously run several of Google's performance tools
(Lighthouse, PageSpeed Insights, Webpage Test) against a URL, all at once.
[Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) is used
to take screenshots of the results from each tool and create an aggregated PDF
of all results.

### Explainer

> Start the server with `npm start`.

The frontend (http://localhost:8080) UI displays a list of tools for the user
to select.

When "Enter" is hit, this fires off a request o the `/run` handler. That handler takes a `url` and
`tools` param. The latter is a "," separated list of tools to run. One of LH, PSI, WPT.

The response is a JSON array of the tools that were run (e.g. `["LH", "PSI"]`).

Note: every run of the tool logs the URL that was audited and tools to that were
run to runs.txt.

**Examples**

Run Lighthouse and PSI against https://example.com:

http://localhost:8080/run?url=https://example.com/&tools=LH,PSI

Run Lighthouse against https://example.com using full chrome:

http://localhost:8080/run?url=https://example.com/&tools=LH&headless=false

### Installation & Setup

Check the repo and run `npm i`. You'll need Node 8+ support for ES modules to work.

### Development

Start the server in the project root:

```
npm start
```

Lint:

```
npm run lint
```

For development, both `serviceAccount.json` and `bitlyAccount.json` are required. 

- Follow instructions from [https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#createanewserviceaccount](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances#createanewserviceaccount) to get serviceAccount.json. 
- Create an Bitly account from https://dev.bitly.com/my_apps.html and get access token for `bitlyAccount.json`.
